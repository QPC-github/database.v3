Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Databases

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables Google Search
Appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Connector for Databases enables the appliance to traverse
databases and index rows in the form of documents.

The connector communicates with the databases using the MyBatis
library, which is built on top of the JDBC. So the connector could
work with any database that supports JDBC.

This source code repository is for version 3 of the connector. For
information about the latest version of the Connector for Databases,
see the version 4 overview page and GitHub project:
